## The implementation of deep learning to develop an adequate tool for identifying the bumblebee species in Ireland

In this project, we trained, tested and evaluated ten pre-trained CNN models to build a tool that can adequately predict the classes of unlabelled bumblebee images taken in Ireland.

Before training, at
